# 🔢 Simple Calculator

Welcome to my very first web project — a **Basic Calculator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**! 🚀  
This is a small but proud step in my journey as a web developer.

## ✨ About the Project

This calculator does what it says on the tin:  
**Add, subtract, multiply, and divide — quickly and cleanly.**  
It’s minimal, functional, and built entirely from scratch as part of my learning adventure in web development.

- Structuring a webpage with **HTML**
- Styling with **CSS** to make things not just work, but *look good too*
- Adding interactivity through **JavaScript**
